# B-tree

This directory contains a working implementation of a B-tree, based on Cormen, Chapter 18.

**To compile:** Make uses g++ as the compiler. g++ must be installed for this makefile to work.

## Information about implementation
The B-tree keys are type integer. This is just a B-tree structure implementation. This would be need to be modified with disk-read and disk-writes for a database implementation.

## TODO:
- Implement a remove method.
- Implement key search method.
- Implement a check for duplicate keys.
